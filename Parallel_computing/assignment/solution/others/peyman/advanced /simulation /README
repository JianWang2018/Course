This is a slimmed version of an interconnect flow-level simulator.
It handles only the xgft topology, to compile the program:

make

to run the program:

./a.out xgft 2 12 24 1 12 10000 10000 DMODK 100 1000 d40

This simulation read data from file d40 and produce output file sim_result

The program that needs to be parallelized are in sim_engine_v3.c

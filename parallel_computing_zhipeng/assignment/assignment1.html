<h2> Parallel Exploratory Search</h2>
<p>
Othello (also known as Reversi) is a strategy game played on an 8 x 8 gameboard.
The rules to the game and a brief explanation of strategy issues 
are available on the Wikipedia page for 
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi>Reversi</a>.
There is an <a href=http://www.mathsisfun.com/games/reversi.html>
online version of the game</a> that you can play
to familiarize yourself with the game.
<b>A sequential program that enables two human players to play Othello is
included <a href=othello.c>here</a>. You may use this program as you
see fit to get a jump start on your assignment. 
You may include any or all of the provided code in your submitted
program.
Feel free to use
the code directly as the basis for your parallel solution.</b> 
Some of you may be uncomfortable with the board representation
that I have chosen using bits of a 64-bit integer. If so, you may prefer to
rewrite the code using a 64-element array of characters as the board
representation. While this is less compact, it is equally acceptable.
If you would find it more intuitive to develop your own solution from scratch
rather than building upon the code that I provided, that is fine as
well, but not necessary.
<p>
Write a shared-memory parallel program in Cilk Plus that enables 
the computer to play the
game. Implement the computer player as a parallel function that plays
Othello/Reversi by searching <em>n</em> moves ahead to select the "best
board position" for its move. For example, searching 1 move ahead for
Player 1 means selecting best legal move for Player 1 based only on 
comparing the board states that would result from any of the possible 
legal moves for Player 1. Searching 2
moves ahead for Player 1 means selecting the move that would result in the best
board position after Player 1's move followed by Player 2's best
move. This process of considering alternating 
moves generalizes naturally to consider lookaheads of <em>n</em> moves.
Note that if one player cannot move, his opponent can move again if 
any legal moves remain; your search should account for this accordingly.
You will want to use a version of the <a
href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax>minimax algorithm</a> to
choose the best move.
<b>Note:</b> Constructing a sophisticated board evaluator to compute
the best strategic move is beyond the scope of the assignment. A simple
board evaluator that computes the best move by maximizing the difference between the number of your disks and the number of the opponents disks on the board
will suffice.
<p>
Unless you specifically design your program to be deterministic,
the sequence of moves the computer player performs will be
unpredictable. You are required to use a Cilk Plus reducer to enforce determinism in
your program by using it to deterministically select a move 
from the set of one or more moves with the best score. 
The <a href=https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/684236>Intel
Cilk Plus Programmer's Guide</a> describes reducers and how to work with
them. The example in directory
<tt>/projects/comp422/cilkplus-examples/sum</tt>
and the comments in the reducer include files in 
<tt>/opt/apps/software/Core/icc/2015.2.164/include/cilk</tt>
on davinci.rice.edu should be helpful in understanding how to use reducers
or write a custom reducer. You can use a provided reducer or write
a custom reducer.
If you want to write a custom reducer, you can 
parameterize a <tt>cilk::reducer_max</tt> template.
<p>
<h3>Input specification</h3>
<ul>
<li> The program should prompt for the user to enter an 'h' or 'c' to
specify if player 1 is a human or computer player.
</li>
<li> If player 1 is a computer player, it should prompt for an
integer between 1 and 60 that specifies its search depth.
</li>
<li> The program should prompt for the user to enter an 'h' or 'c' to
specify if player 2 is a human or computer player.
</li>
<li> If player 2 is a computer player, it should prompt for an
integer between 1 and 60 that specifies the search depth (the number
of moves ahead the computer should explore when chosing its move).
</li>
</ul>
The sample input file given <a href=sample-input-assignment1.txt>here</a> 
specifies that the computer will play both sides of the game and
that each player will search seven moves ahead to select where to place
its disk.
<br>

<h3>
Output specification
</h3>
Given an input file as specified above for two computer players, 
the program should run to completion. When the program begins, it
should
print the initial game board configuration. After each move, the
program should print the 'row,column' position of the move, 
specify which disks were flipped,
indicate how many disks were flipped, and reprint the game board. At the
end of the game, the program should print out the final game board, the total
number of disks for each player, and announce the winner. 
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Experiments</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Your submitted
program should be free of data races. 
Cilk Plus's <tt>cilkscreen</tt> tool uses binary rewriting to instrument
your executable to check itself for data races as it runs.
Running your program with <tt>cilkscreen</tt> at the front of the command
line will check an execution for data races.
If <tt>cilkscreen</tt> reports races, make sure that you 
compile your program with the <tt>-g</tt>
flag and run it again. (Executables compiled with <tt>-g</tt> have
more detailed race reports, which will help you identify the
references involved in the data races.)
</li>
<br>
<li> Compile your program using -O2 optimization. All of the execution
measurements described below should be performed with this version of
your executable.</li>
<br>
<li>
Cilk Plus's <tt>cilkview</tt> tool uses binary rewriting to instrument
your program to profile its parallelism. 
<tt>cilkview</tt> will report the total amount of work in your program, the critical path length, the average parallelism, as well other measures such as the total number of stack frames, spawns, and syncs. 
The input file provided above will
direct your program to have the computer play for each player with a
lookahead depth of seven. 
Construct variants of the provided input to have each computer
player use matching lookahead depths ranging from 1-6. For each lookahead
depth 1-7, use <tt>cilkview</tt> to profile your program and record
your measurements. Include the measurements results 
from <tt>cilkview</tt> in your report in a table.
</li>
<br>
<li>
<font size=4 style="color:red">COMP 534 Only: </font>Use the <tt>hpctoolkit</tt> to determine 
where your program is spending the majority of its time. As described
at the bottom of the assignment, grading of programs
submitted by COMP 534 students will place more weight on scalability
and performance than programs submitted by COMP 422 students. 
HPCToolkit can help you identify problematic code in your program that
consumes unreasonable time or scales poorly.
More information about how to use HPCToolkit can be found in its 
<a href=http://hpctoolkit.org/manual/HPCToolkit-users-manual.pdf>documentation</a>. HPCToolkit is
available as a module on DAVinci.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Run the program with the input file provided 
above (using a lookahead depth of seven) on each of 1-12 cores.
To control the number of cores used by your program use <tt>CILK_NWORKERS=n time othello < input</tt>, where n is the number of processors you want. 
Record the real, user, and system time for the
run on each number of cores. 
</li>
<br>
<li>
Write a document that describes how your program works. This document
should <em>not</em> include your program, though it may include one or
more figures
containing pseudo-code that sketches key elements of the
parallelization strategy. Explain how your program exploits 
parallelism. Explain why you chose to exploit parallelism in this
way. Were there any opportunities for parallelism that you chose not
to exploit? If so, why? Explain how the parallel work is synchronized.
Include a table containing information from the output of 
<tt>cilkview</tt> for lookahead depths 1-7 in
your report.
Discuss and explain the differences you observe in the profiles with
different lookahead depths. 
Prepare a graph of the efficiency of your parallelization comparing
the real times measured on 1-12 cores. Plot a point for each of the
executions. The x axis should show the number
of cores. The Y axis should show your measured parallel
efficiency for the execution.
Parallel efficiency is computed as
<em>S/(p * T(p))</em>, where <em>S</em> represents the
real time of a sequential execution of your program, 
<em>p</em> is the number of processors and <em>T(p)</em> is the real
time of the execution on <em>p</em> processors. 
Discuss your efficiency findings and the quality of the parallelization.
<p><b>Note</b>:
Don't make the
mistake of using the execution time of a one thread version of your
parallel implementation as the time of a sequential execution. 
The
execution time of the one-thread parallel implementation is typically
larger than that of the original sequential implementation. When you
compute parallel efficiency, always use the performance of a
sequential code as a baseline; otherwise, you will
overestimate the value of your parallelization.  
<p>
The sequential execution time of your Cilk Plus program is <em>not</em>
the same as the execution time of a Cilk Plus program with one
worker. To provide a baseline for your parallel efficiency
measurements, you can 
create a <i>serialization</i> of your program that will execute
sequentially
without the overhead of the Cilk Plus runtime. Follow the directions at <a href=https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/684244>Intel
Cilk Plus Programmer's Guide</a>,
use the <tt>icpc</tt> compiler to compile up
a serialization of your program using -O2 optimization.
Measure the wall clock time for an execution of your serialization 
on the input with
lookahead depth seven using the Unix "time" command.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Submitting your Assignment</h2>
Your assignment should be submitted in two parts.
<ul>

A single source file containing your Cilk program.
</li>
<br>
<li>A writeup about your program in either Word or PDF format (PDF
preferred). Guidelines for your writeup: 3 pages won't have enough
detail; more than 10 pages will say too much. Plan for a length in
between. Make sure that you address all of the requirements specified
in the "Experiments" section.
</li>
</ul>
You will use the "turnin" utility provided by Rice IT for
submitting your assignments. 
See the 
<a href=https://docs.rice.edu/confluence/x/qAiUAQ>
turnin
page</a> for details about how
to submit your assignment.  If you have trouble using turnin and come up against the deadline for submitting your assignment, 
email me a tar file with your source code and  attach your write up to the
email.

<h2>Setting up Cilk Plus on DAVinCI</h2>
<p>To load the suite of Cilk Plus tools, first set your module path

<ul>
<p><tt>module use /projects/comp422/modulefiles</tt>
</ul>

<p>Next, load the module that contains paths to the Cilk Plus compiler and tools.

<ul>
<p><tt>module load cilk-comp422</tt>
</ul>

The Cilk Plus compiler is <tt>icpc</tt>.

<h2>Setting up HPCToolkit on DAVinCi</h2>

Load the HPCToolkit module.

<ul>
<p><tt> module load hpctoolkit-comp422 </tt>
</ul>

<h2>Data Race Detection Tools</h2>
<p>
To check your program for data races, you will need to use <tt>cilkscreen</tt>.
To check your program for data races with <tt>cilkscreen</tt>, simply
launch your program with <tt>cilkscreen</tt>:
<ul>
    <tt>cilkscreen othello < input</tt>
</ul>
<p>

<h2>Using SLURM on DAVinCI</h2>
<p> While you can develop your program on one of the login nodes on
DAVinCI, you should run your experiments on one of the compute nodes
using the SLURM job manager. You can obtain a private node to run your
job on by requesting a node for an interactive session using
<ul>
    srun
    --pty --export=ALL --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=1
    --cpus-per-task=12
    --mem=1G --time=00:30:00 bash
</ul>

<p>I strongly recommend developing and
testing your code (with small lookahead depth) on the login node to
avoid the surprise of having your editor be killed as your interactive
session on the compute node expires. See the documentation on <a
href=https://docs.rice.edu/confluence/display/ITDIY/Getting+Started+on+DAVinCI>
Using DAVinCI</a> under the tab "Submitting Jobs" for more information
about using SLURM.

Here is a sample SLURM batch script
<a href=othello.sbatch>othello.sbatch</a> that you can launch with
sbatch. Save it in a file othello.sbatch and then launch it as
<ul>
    sbatch othello.sbatch
</ul>
The sample batch script runs the othello program twice with different
numbers of cores. In your script, you can run edit the final few lines
to run othello just once or run it multiple times in a sequence of experiments.

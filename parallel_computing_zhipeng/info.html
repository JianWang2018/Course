<li><b>COMP 422 vs. COMP 534</b>
<p>
COMP 422 is an undergraduate version of this course. COMP 534 is the
graduate version of the course. COMP 422 students
will have four programming assignments. COMP 534 students will have
five. As part of their assignments, both COMP 422 and COMP 534
students will analyze the scalability and parallel efficiency of
parallel programs they write. COMP 534 students will additionally use
tools to qualify the root causes of scaling losses in their programs
and document their findings. Mutually Exclusive: Credit cannot be
earned for COMP 534 and COMP 422.

</p> <p>
<li><b>Evaluation:</b>  Coursework will be weighted as follows: 
<ul>
<li>Programming Assignments 95% </li>
<li>Class participation 5%</li>
</ul>
</li>
</p><p>
<li><b>Class Participation</b>
<p>Students are expected to attend lectures and are encouraged to ask questions.</p>

<li><b>Programming Assignments</b>
<p>There will be four programming assignments in the
semester. Programming assignments are to be done individually.

You may discuss assignments with others, but you must code your own
solutions and submit them with a write-up
in your own words. Indicate clearly the name(s)
of student(s) you collaborated with, if any. Although homework
assignments will not be pledged, per se, the submitted solutions must
be your work and not copied from other students' assignments or other
sources. See the section on Misconduct for details about what is
prohibited.
</p></li>

<li><b>Communication</b>

<p>
COMP 422/534 will use a moderated discussion group on www.piazza.com 
for day-to-day
communication. The class piazza page can be found here:
<a href=https://piazza.com/rice/spring2017/comp422534/home>
https://piazza.com/rice/spring2017/comp422534/home</a>.
If you have a technical question about a programming assignment,
parallel systems, or anything else related to the course, 
please post it to the discussion group rather than sending it directly to the
instructor or a TA. This will enable everyone in the class to
benefit from questions and answers. Only inquires of a personal nature
should be made directly to the instructor or TAs. 
</p>
<p>
Any email sent directly to a TA or instructor should include "COMP
422/534" in the subject line to avoid having it overlooked amidst a torrent of incoming email.
</p></li>

<li><b>Policy on Late Work</b>

<p>I recognize that you have other demands on your time besides COMP
422/534
programming assignments. As a result, you will have a total of 7 "slip
days" throughout the semester that you can use at your discretion to
turn in programming assignments past the posted deadline. Slip days
are used in whole day increments. Once your slip days are consumed,
late programming assignments will be penalized at 10% per day.

</p></li>

<li><b>Misconduct</b>

<p>
You may not transmit or receive code from anyone in the class in any
way--visually (by showing someone your code), electronically (by
emailing, posting, or otherwise sending someone your code), verbally
(by reading your code to someone), or in any other way.
</p>

<p>
You may not collaborate with people who are not your classmates, TAs,
or instructor in any way. For example, you may not post questions to 
programming forums. Submitting requests for help using Rice computing
facilities, e.g., the batch queues, to the Center for Research
Computing
(<a
href=https://docs.rice.edu/confluence/display/ITDIY/Request+Help+with+Research+Computing+Resources>Help
Request Page</a>)
is allowed.
</p>

<p>
You may search the web and use any
information that you find. However, you cannot take more than two
lines of code from an external resource and actually include it in
one of your assignments. Changing variable names or rewriting code you
find does not void the "two line rule."
</p>

<p>
Any violations of these rules will be reported to the honor council.
</p>

</li>

<li><b>Accommodations</b>
<p>
If you have a documented disability that will impact your work in this
class, please contact me during the first two weeks of the semester to
discuss your needs. All discussions will remain confidential.
Additionally, you will need to register with Disability Support
Services in the Allen Center.
</p>
